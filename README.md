# ncbi parser
## description
I created a parser for ncbi databases. If you want to download fasta files and organize them in terms of genes and systematic names, I suggest you test the script. Before you run it, install the biopython library using the pip command. Also pay attention to the save path, it needs to be changed. For those who want to better understand biopython, please refer to: http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
